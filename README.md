# Nixuge's Vendetta Plugins
Some plugins for Vendetta [Vendetta](https://github.com/vendetta-mod/Vendetta), or its up to date fork [Bunny](https://github.com/pyoncord/Bunny)

## TODO - REPO
Landing page & remove the jank thing in deploy.yml.

# Plugins
## URL Overrides
A plugin that allows you to redirect some urls to other.

### How to use:
Should be pretty straight forwards. If you use regex groups, you can use them by placing "$n" with n being the index of the group (starts at 1)

**TODO:**
- Allow to organize overrides since they're order based.

# How to install?
Paste the links of the plugins you want into vendetta:
